# Hello there!

We’re a small crew from Galicia into building useful tools, breaking things (legally), and learning.

Mostly focused on:
- Cybersecurity, Ethical Hacking & Computer Forensics
- Fullstack Development (Web & Android)
- Rust, Python, Bash... (Whatever works)
- Tinkering, scripting, automating.
- Sharing what we make. (No gatekeeping)

#

![Puter](https://github.com/XoanOuteiro/GIFS_forReadme/blob/main/banners/old_computer.gif)

We publish open source projects we actually use, and we’re always open to collaborations, ideas, or just hanging out with like-minded devs.

**Not a startup. Not a brand. Just a bunch of folks who enjoy craftsmanship in tech.**
